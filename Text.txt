The Samaveda is the Veda of Chants, or "storehouse of knowledge of chants".[14] According to Frits Staal, it is "the Rigveda set to music".[15] It is a fusion of older melodies (sāman) and the Rig verses.[15] It has far fewer verses than Rigveda,[6] but Samaveda is textually larger because it lists all the chant- and rituals-related score modifications of the verses.[15]

The Samaveda text contains notated melodies, and these are probably the world's oldest surviving ones.[13] The musical notation is written usually immediately above, sometimes within, the line of Samaveda text, either in syllabic or a numerical form depending on the Samavedic Sakha (school).[16]

the Kauthuma recension is current in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and since a few decades in Darbhanga, Bihar,
the Rāṇāyanīya in the Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gokarna, few parts of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh
and the Jaiminiya in the Carnatic, Tamil Nadu and Kerala
