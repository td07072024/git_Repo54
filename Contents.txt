Samaveda samhita is not meant to be read as a text, it is like a musical score sheet that must be heard.[3]

Staal states that the melodies likely existed before the verses in ancient India, and the words of the Rigveda verses were mapped into those pre-existing melodies, because some early words fit and flow, while later words do not quite fit the melody in the same verse.[3] The text uses creative structures, called Stobha, to help embellish, transform or play with the words so that they better fit into a desired musical harmony.[22][23] Some verses add in meaningless sounds of a lullaby, for probably the same reason, remarks Staal.[3] Thus the contents of the Samaveda represent a tradition and a creative synthesis of music, sounds, meaning and spirituality, the text was not entirely a sudden inspiration.[3]

The portion of the first song of Samaveda illustrates the link and mapping of Rigvedic verses into a melodic chant:[3]


The veena (vīṇā) is mentioned in Samaveda.[24]
अग्न आ याहि वीतये – Rigveda 6.16.10[25]
Agna ā yāhi vītaye

Samaveda transformation (Jaiminiya manuscript):
o gnā i / ā yā hi vā i / tā yā i tā yā i /

Translation:
O Agni, come to the feast.

— Samaveda 1.1.1, Translated by Frits Staal[3]
Multiple melodies were created by clans of sages from a Yonimantra, which is a base Mantra for Sama Chanting. Gautama's Parka was one such example cited by Dr. Damodar Satwalekar in his book Samveda.[26]
