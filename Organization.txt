The Samaveda comprises two major parts. The first part include four melody collections and the second part three verse "books" .[4] A melody in the song books corresponds to a verse in the aarchika books.[4] The Gana collection is subdivided into Gramageya and Aranyageya, while the Arcika portion is subdivided into Purvarcika and Uttararcika portions.[17] The Purvarcika portion of the text has 585 single stanza verses and is organized in order of deities, while Uttararcika text is ordered by rituals.[17] The Gramageya melodies are those for public recitations, while Aranyageya melodies are for personal meditative use such as in the solitude of a forest.[17] Typically, the Purvarcika collection were sung to melodies described in the Gramageya-Gānas index, and the rules of how the verses mapped to verses is described in the Sanskrit texts such as the Puspasutra.[17]

Just like Rigveda, the early sections of Samaveda typically begin with Agni and Indra hymns but shift to abstract speculations and philosophy, and their meters too shifts in a descending order.[4] The later sections of the Samaveda, states Witzel, have least deviation from substance of hymns they derive from Rigveda into songs.[4] The purpose of Samaveda was liturgical, and they were the repertoire of the udgātṛ or "singer" priests.[4]

The Samaveda, like other Vedas, contains several layers of text, with Samhita being the oldest and the Upanishads the youngest layer.[18]

Including these repetitions, there are a total of 1,875 verses numbered in the Samaveda recension translated by Griffith.[21]
